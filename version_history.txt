version 0.0.2: minimax vs. minimax, using max.depth, hashmap, and alpha-beta pruning to speed up
               importance in improving Time Complexity: max.depth > alpha-beta pruning > hashmap
               because the potential max. depth = 6 x 7 = 42, which means 2^42 combinations!
               limiting max.depth = 5 means a lot less combinations;
               hashmap is not that helpful because many combinations tend to be unique
