version 0.0.3: minimax vs. minimax, using (1) max.depth, (2) hashmap, and (3) alpha-beta pruning to speed up
               importance in improving Time Complexity: max.depth > hashmap > alpha-beta pruning
               this is because the potential max. depth = 6 x 7 = 42, which means 2^42 combinations!
               limiting max.depth = 5 means a lot less combinations;
               hashmap is helpful because it remembers the best moves from previous games
